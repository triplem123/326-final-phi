# Idea
A platform for users that are in the process of either moving or renovating their homes. The platform will allow users to decide on how they would like to arrange things in their room such as furniture, lamps, plants, etc. The users will create an account in order to save all of their data for later use and to give them the ability to use other features that will be detailed later. Once their account is created, a user can create their room with specific dimensions and other features. Once their room's size and shape has been set up, they can add any pieces of furniture and other things that occupy their room from a given list of shapes and rearrange everything until they find a desired layout. After finalizing a layout, users can save thelayout for later, save an image of their desired setup, or share it for other users to use as an example. 

# Components
The application will let users create a 2D dimension of the room they want to focus on (with attaches pantries, closets, etc). Users can also add outlet placements in the room they are designing, so it can help them in deciding where to place their gadgets (PCs, TVs, lamps, etc.). The app will give users a warning when they place a piece of furniture that covers an outlet. They can select a piece of furniture in any shape (L shaped sofa, oval coffee table, etc.), input the size of it and drag and drop it on the 2D room scale. The shapes can be edited to be more accurate to what the user has for furniture, such as making a rectangular table sample shape longer or more narrow. If users already have furniture, it can help them figure out what can fit where and how to arrange it to maximize space to their liking. If users donâ€™t have furniture, this platform can help them decide what furniture they would like to buy and in what size. If there are other people that would like to input their ideas too, the user can invite them to edit their design. They can create multiple combinations and save them to their folder and decide what they like the most. They can also create multiple rooms for office space, living room, etc. If a user has finalized a room layout and actually created it in real life, they will have the ability to upload images of the setup and share it online along with the virtual room design for others to see.
