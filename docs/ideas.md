# Idea
A platform for users that are in the process of either moving or renovating their homes. This platform will allow users to decide on how they would like to arrange their furniture the best. The application will let users create a 2D dimension of the room they want to focus on (with attaches pantries, closets, etc). They can select a piece of furniture in any shape (L shaped sofa, oval coffee table, etc.), input the size of it and drag and drop it on the 2D room scale. If users already have furniture, it can help them figure out what can fit where and how to arrange it to maximize space to their liking. If users donâ€™t have furniture, this platform can help them decide what furniture they would like to buy and in what size. If there are other people that would like to input their ideas too, the user can invite them to edit their design. They can create multiple combinations and save them to their folder and decide what they like the most. They can also create multiple rooms for office space, living room, etc.  Users can also add outlet placements in the room they are designing, so it can help them in deciding where to place their gadgets (PCs, TVs, lamps, etc.). the app will give users a warning when they place a piece of furniture that covers an outlet.
